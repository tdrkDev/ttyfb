Introduction
------------
ttyfb, ttyui are libraries allowing you to display graphics
in tty through /dev/fb0. Performance of these libraries is not
so good... Anyway, this is beta and as example, in main.c there 
are mini drawing game. ttyfb programs should be run with the
superuser's rights.

ttyfb
-----
ttyfb is the lowest-level library in this repository. It access
directly framebuffer and have some wrappers (put_rect() and more)
to display easy figures and PNG image with lodepng library.

- API:
int ttyfb_init(struct ttyfb *fb)
    Initializes ttyfb structure. You SHOULD call this function
    before any other calls to ttyfb API.

void ttyfb_exit(struct ttyfb *fb)
    Destructs ttyfb structure and closes framebuffer. You SHOULD 
    call this function on exit of your program.

void put_pixel(struct ttyfb *fb, struct ttyfb_color clr, int x, int y)
    Displays pixel in X, Y position with given color.

void put_square(ttyfb_t *fb, ttyfb_color_t clr, int x, int y, int size)
    Puts square on given position (it specifies right top corner
    of square) with given color and size.

void put_rect(ttyfb_t *fb, ttyfb_color_t clr, int x, int y, int x2, int y2)
    Puts rectangle on given position (it specifies right top corner
    of rectangle) with given color and width (x2), height (y2);

void put_ellipse(ttyfb_t *fb, ttyfb_color_t clr, int x, int y, int h, int w)
    Puts ellipse on given position (it specifies center of ellipse) 
    with given color and width (w), height (h);

void put_img(ttyfb_t *fb, int ix, int iy, char *filename)
    Loads PNG image with lodepng and displays it on
    given position (ix, iy; specifies right top corner).

ttyui
-----
Currently it can only give you access to mouse.

- API:
int ttyui_init(struct ttyfb *fb)
    Initializes ttyui. Should be called before mouse structure
    access.

void ttyfb_close(struct ttyfb *fb)
    Closes ttyui. It's recommended to call this function on
    program exit.

struct ttyfb_mouse *mouse (global variable)
    Current mouse state. Updates on separate thread.
    Update stops only on ttyfb_close() or program exit.
